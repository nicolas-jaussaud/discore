- Load and register the main character
- Register the square types that will compose your map(s)
- Generate and load the inital map

Each steps is covered in the following guides:
- [Create a new app](./pages/guides/create-app.md)
- [Load characters](./pages/guides/load-characters.md)
- [Register square types](./pages/guides/register-square-types.md)
- [Load maps](./pages/guides/load-maps.md)
- [Import objects](./pages/guides/import-objects.md)

There is also the [quick start example](./pages/examples/quick-start.md), which is a small and minimal example of a discore app creation.
