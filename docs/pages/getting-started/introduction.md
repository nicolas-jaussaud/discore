## Getting started

### Introduction

Discore is a JavaScript library built on top of [threejs](https://threejs.org/). 

Discore can be used to:
- Create small isometric worlds, with re-usable elements (based on re-usable [squares](./pages/guides/register-square-types.md))
- Easily control a character through mouse interactions
- Import and animate side characters
